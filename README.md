# docker-mariadb-utf8
The official MariaDB Docker image, with sane Unicode defaults.

The only change is custom config file my.cnf to set default collation and character set to UTF-8
according to official MariaDB documentation.

## Usage
See official documentation.

## Version
This package will generally track the current MariaDB latest version, but may be delayed (if I'm lazy). I'll probably write an autobuild script for this at some point.
